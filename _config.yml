description: I am an architect specialized on timber construction and digital fabrication. I am currently doing a PhD in 'augmented reality' and carpentry at IBOIS (Laboratory for Timber Construction), at EPFL (Switzerland). I am deeply interested in wearable devices and sensors that can help humans in performing better at their tasks. Computer vision, point cloud processing, microprocessors and software and product development are among my topics of interest. If you have a nice project or collaboration about these things, do not hesitate to drop a message at andreasettimi@epfl.ch.
