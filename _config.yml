  I am a diplomed EPFL architect specialized on timber construction and digital fabrication. I am currently doing a PhD in augmented reality and carpentry at IBOIS (Laboratory for Timber Construction), at EPFL (Switzerland). I am interested in wearable devices and sensors that can help humans in performing better at work. Computer vision, point cloud processing, microprocessors and software development are among my topics of interest.
