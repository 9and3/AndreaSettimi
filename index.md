### Augmented carpentry

`#TimberConstruction`
`#DigitalFabrication`
`#AugmentedReality`
`#AssistedFabrication`
`#ComputerVision`
`#SmartTools`

This is my main research topic I am currently exploring at IBOIS in my PhD Thesis with [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (post-doc, IBOIS) and [Yves Weinand](https://people.epfl.ch/yves.weinand) (thesis director, IBOIS). 
The research illustrates the integration and use of ordinary electric tools into a context-aware AR framework for assisting users in timber carpentry task. The research is still at a preliminary stage in which we outline the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and accuracy of object-aware and tool-aware AR-assisted fabrication systems. The investigated systems leverage computer vision tools and sensors to empower human workers with robotic-like precision and accuracy. The goal is to allow workers to carry out complex drilling angles operations by following computer-processed feedback instead of drawings, marking or jigs. The research is currently financed by EPFL (Ecole Polythéchnique Fédérale de Lausanne). If you are interested in collaborating on similar topics, please send an email (see contacts below).

### Cluster ENAC on Hybrid Timber Structures

`#TimberConstruction`
`#DigitalFabrication`
`#AugmentedReality`
`#AssistedFabrication`
`#SmartTools`

The cluster ENAC grant is a project in collaboration with [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (post-doc, IBOIS) under the direction of [Yves Weinand](https://people.epfl.ch/yves.weinand) (thesis director, IBOIS). 
Traditional hybrid stone-timber structures are part of an ancient craftsmanship heritage which is labor-intensive and requires qualified workers. Nevertheless, these dry and glue-free construction systems using locally available materials have all the qualities defined today as sustainable: reuse of mineral waste, low embodied energy, low embodied water content, demountable, cement-free; and moreover earthquake-resistant. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to draw inspiration from this traditional construction method to propose ecological and sustainable stone-timber structures that meet the requirements of modern buildings. Today’s advanced digital tools are leveraged to develop an automated design-production framework to generate new designs, reduce labor intensity, and optimize cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, developing such a framework is central to bridge the historical, theoretical and practical knowledge to foster new architectural expressions. New engineering methods are also investigated to go beyond the rather empirical knowledge based on heuristic rules for traditional constructions and define a clear and precise structural design approach. This project is financed by EPFL ENAC Cluster Grant.

### Cockroach

`#PointCloud`
`#AutomaticClustering`
`#ScanningTechniques`

This is a project in collaboration with [Petras Vestartas](https://people.epfl.ch/petras.vestartas?lang=en)(post-doc, IBOIS). Cockroach is a open-source plug-in to help researchers working for PointCloud processing in .NET. At IBOIS - EPFL, among other research lines, we have also been focusing on structures with unpredictable geometries such as raw wood and mineral scraps. These construction elements are scanned and post-processed into low-poly meshes or NURBS for design, i.e. 3D timber joinery representation and fabrication tool-paths for 5-axis CNC, 6-axis robot and XR manufacture. Cockroach is a plugin developed to introduce various commands for point cloud post-processing and meshing into Rhinoceros® [4] environment based on reference functions already existing in the open-source library Open3D, CGAL, Cilantro.
