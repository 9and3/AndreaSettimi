## Augmented carpentry

`#TimberConstruction`
`#DigitalFabrication`
`#AugmentedReality`
`#AssistedFabrication`
`#ComputerVision`
`#SmartTools`

This is my main research topic I am currently exploring at IBOIS in my PhD Thesis with [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (PostDoc, IBOIS) and [Yves Weinand](https://people.epfl.ch/yves.weinand) (Thesis Director, IBOIS). 
The research illustrates the integration and use of ordinary electric tools into a context-aware AR framework for assisting users in timber carpentry task. The research is still at a preliminary stage in which we outline the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and accuracy of object-aware and tool-aware AR-assisted fabrication systems. The investigated systems leverage computer vision tools and sensors to empower human workers with robotic-like precision and accuracy. The goal is to allow workers to carry out complex drilling angles operations by following computer-processed feedback instead of drawings, marking or jigs. The research is currently financed by EPFL (Ecole Polythéchnique Fédérale de Lausanne). If you are interested in collaborating on similar topics, please send an email (see contacts below).

## Cluster ENAC on Hybrid Timber Structures

`#TimberConstruction`
`#DigitalFabrication`
`#AugmentedReality`
`#AssistedFabrication`
`#SmartTools`

The cluster ENAC grant is a project in collaboration with [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (PostDoc, IBOIS) under the direction of [Yves Weinand](https://people.epfl.ch/yves.weinand) (Thesis Director, IBOIS). 
Traditional hybrid stone-timber structures are part of an ancient craftsmanship heritage which is labor-intensive and requires qualified workers. Nevertheless, these dry and glue-free construction systems using locally available materials have all the qualities defined today as sustainable: reuse of mineral waste, low embodied energy, low embodied water content, demountable, cement-free; and moreover earthquake-resistant. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to draw inspiration from this traditional construction method to propose ecological and sustainable stone-timber structures that meet the requirements of modern buildings. Today’s advanced digital tools are leveraged to develop an automated design-production framework to generate new designs, reduce labor intensity, and optimize cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, developing such a framework is central to bridge the historical, theoretical and practical knowledge to foster new architectural expressions. New engineering methods are also investigated to go beyond the rather empirical knowledge based on heuristic rules for traditional constructions and define a clear and precise structural design approach. This project is financed by EPFL ENAC Cluster Grant.

## Cockroach

`#PointCloud`
`#AutomaticClustering`
`#ScanningTechniques`

This is a project in collaboration with [Petras Vestartas](https://people.epfl.ch/petras.vestartas?lang=en) (PostDoc, IBOIS). Cockroach is a open-source plug-in to help researchers working for PointCloud processing in .NET. At IBOIS - EPFL, among other research lines, we have also been focusing on structures with unpredictable geometries such as raw wood and mineral scraps. These construction elements are scanned and post-processed into low-poly meshes or NURBS for design, i.e. 3D timber joinery representation and fabrication tool-paths for 5-axis CNC, 6-axis robot and XR manufacture. Cockroach is a plugin developed to introduce various commands for point cloud post-processing and meshing into Rhinoceros® environment based on reference functions already existing in the open-source library Open3D, CGAL, Cilantro. 
You can find the Rhino Plug-in [here] (https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/cockroach) or the open-source in our [GitHub] (https://github.com/9and3/Cockroach).

## Current Teaching

### Introduction to Computational Architecture, EPFL, Teaching assistant, Spring 2022

`#Coding`
`#ComputationalDesign`
`#CAD`

The teaching team is composed by [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (PostDoc, IBOIS), [Petras Vestartas](https://people.epfl.ch/petras.vestartas?lang=en)(PostDoc, IBOIS), [Nicolas Rogeau] (https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.rogeau) (PhD, IBOIS) and myself. The main objective of the course is to develop a computational mindset among architecture students in order to maximize the use of digital tools in the different phases of an architectural project. Based on the knowledge acquired during the first two years in the various courses (géométrie pour architectes, modélisation numérique, introduction aux outils CAO en architecture, stéréotomie), this course deepens the basics in 3D modeling and parametric design and establishes the foundation in computer coding associated with architectural modeling. 

### Quantitative imaging for civil engineering, EPFL, Lecturer, Autmn 2021

`#Coding`
`#ComputerVision`
`#PointCloudProcessing`
`#3DScanning`

The course is lead by [Andò Edward Carlo Giorgio](https://people.epfl.ch/edward.ando?lang=fr) (Professor, from Université Grenoble Alpes) at EPFL.
This course will arm students with knowledge of different imaging techniques for practical use to make measurements in many different fields of civil engineering. Modalities will range from satellite and drone imaging all the way down to microscopy and x-ray tomography with practical sessions.

### AR-assisted timber drilling with smart retrofitted tools (published soon)

`#TimberConstruction`

`#AugmentedReality`

`#SmartTools`
`#ToolRetrofitting`

Authors: [Andrea Settimi] (https://people.epfl.ch/andrea.settimi?lang=en) (PhD, IBOIS), [Julien Gamerro](https://people.epfl.ch/julien.gamerro) (PostDoc, IBOIS), [Yves Weinand](https://people.epfl.ch/yves.weinand) (Thesis Director, IBOIS).
The paper illustrates a preliminary study to outline the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and accuracy of an AR framework for assisting users in timber drilling task. The designed workflow leverages computer vision tools and sensors to implement an inside-out tracking technique for retrofitted drills based on a reverseengineering approach. The goal is to allow workers to carry out complex drilling angles operations by following computer-processed feedback instead of drawings, marking or jigs. First, the developed methodology is presented with its different devices and functioning phases. Second, this first proof of concept is evaluated with an experimental campaign consisting in 3D scanning the produced perforations and comparing the discrepancies with their respective 3D execution models. In the conclusions, the paper outlines further improvements of the proposed tool-aware fabrication process, and clarifies the possible role to play of augmented carpentry in the near future digital fabrication landscape.

## About my formation

I was born in 1993 in Perugia, Italy. After graduating from a scientific Liceo I moved in Belgium where I did my Bachelor in Architecture at ULB - La Cambre Horta. In 2016 I did a one-year master in timber construction and technology at the Wood Program, Aalto University, Finland. Next I worked as an architect in Bosshard Vaquer Architekten office, in Zürich. I than obtained my Master in Architecture at EPFL (Ecole Polythéchnique Fédérale de Lausanne), where in 2020 I started my PhD at IBOIS (Laboratory for Timber Construction) in Augmented Reality in timber construction.
