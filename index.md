Here are the projects I am currently involved in. You can also find my preavious projects and open-sourced works on [my GitHub](https://github.com/9and3) or the [Git of Ibois](https://github.com/ibois-epfl). Otherwise have a look at the website of the research lab in which I currently do my researches, [here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/).

### Augmented carpentry
`#TimberConstruction` `AR` `#DigitalFabrication` `#AugmentedReality` `#AssistedFabrication` `SmartTools`
This is my main research topic I am currently exploring at IBOIS with [Julien Gamerro] (post-doc) and Yves Weinand (thesis director). 
The research illustrates the integration and use of ordinary electric tools into a context-aware AR framework for assisting users in timber carpentry task. The research is still at a preliminary stage in which we outline the technical challenges, potential bottlenecks, and accuracy of object-aware and tool-aware AR-assisted fabrication systems. The investigated systems leverage computer vision tools and sensors to empower human workers with robotic-like precision and accuracy. The goal is to allow workers to carry out complex drilling angles operations by following computer-processed feedback instead of drawings, marking or jigs. The research is currently financed by EPFL (Ecole Polythéchnique Fédérale de Lausanne).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/9and3/andreasettimi.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
